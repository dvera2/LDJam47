# LDJam47: AKA ROLL
Repositiory for Ludum Dare 47 Jam

This game is built in Unity 2019.4.9f1 and created by Dave Vera and Karen Morrison for Ludum Dare 47 and the itch.io Wholesome Jam
for October 2020.

Help Hammy the Hamster roll his way to his food bowl by using items from the shelf.

The game allows the player to run through a series of simple physics puzzles. In each level
a hamster and a food bowl exist with a set of pre-existing physical objects that alter
the course of little Hammy. Each level starts out as an editable environment, and the player 
can drag an item from the shelf into the play space grid. Pressing 'Go' will run the simulation,
enabling all the objects. Pressing 'Stop' will end the simulation and reset the pieces to their 
last edited state.

Players can place the following items based on availability in the level:
- Hair Dryer: Blows the ball away from it
- Doggo: Knocks the ball up when the ball hits it
- Skateboard ramp: Slopes Hammy up or down
- Woman's pump: Shallow slope
- Plant: Blocks Hammy

The code and assets in this repository are all original and utilize the Unity Tilemap editor tools and TextMeshPro.
